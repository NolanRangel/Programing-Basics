/*Read through the user story below.
In a VS Code file, do the following:
Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.
Using comments, create pseudo-code to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem.
Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving?
User Story

A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is written in First, Second, or Third Person.*/

/*
1. To solve the problem we could create identifiers(pronouns) for the First, Second, and Third person

2.  1. user must be able to input their paragraph.
	2. computer must be able to search through the paragraph for the identifiers.
	3. depending on the identifiers, it will be labeled as, first, second, or third person narrative.
	4. identifiers: First person pronouns (I, me, my, mine and myself), Second person pronouns (you, your, yours, yourself, yourselves),
		Third person pronouns (he, him, his, himself, she, her, hers, herself, it, its, itself, they, them, their, theirs, and themselves).
	5. log out the reults to the user.

3.  1. It sems that the hardest part will be identifying third person pronouns as they can be somewhat vague compared to first and second person pronouns.
	(ex. Tom always enjoyed the restaraunt atmosphere.) Non descript pronouns could cause a lack of information.
	2. We could create a conditional that accounts for no first, second, and third person pronouns which will result with a third person result.
